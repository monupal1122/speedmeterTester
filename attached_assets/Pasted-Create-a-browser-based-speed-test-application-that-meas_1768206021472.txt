Create a browser-based speed test application that measures:

Ping (Latency in ms)

Download Speed (Mbps)

Upload Speed (Mbps)

The speed calculation must be realistic, based on bytes transferred and time taken, considering browser limitations.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Backend

Node.js

Express.js

REST APIs

Frontend

React.js

Modern UI with animations

Optional / Bonus

Charts (Chart.js or similar)

WebSockets for live speed updates

🧱 Backend Requirements

Use a clean, readable structure with:

routes

controllers

services

utils

Do NOT use a database unless required (MongoDB optional).

Do NOT over-engineer with microservices.

Backend APIs:

GET /api/ping → returns latency in milliseconds

GET /api/download-test → calculates download speed in Mbps

POST /api/upload-test → calculates upload speed in Mbps

Speed Calculation Rule:
Speed (Mbps) = (Bytes × 8) / Time(seconds) / 1024 / 1024

🎨 Frontend Requirements

Speedtest.net inspired circular speed meter

Smooth number animation during speed test

Clean, professional UI

Responsive design

Speed Test Flow (Must be Sequential):

User clicks Start Test

Ping test runs

Download speed test runs

Upload speed test runs

Final summary screen is displayed

Important Notes

Do not add authentication, admin panels, or unrelated features.

Keep the implementation simple, realistic, and professional.

Prioritize clarity over complexity.

Output:
Provide complete backend and frontend code with explanations.
